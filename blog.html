	<h1>I will do my best to keep this blog active. If I forget about, bug me!</h1>

	<p>Thick Water Arts is something I've been wanting to do for five years. I want to bring together creators of all kinds - writers, printmakers, illustrators, storytellers, photographers - and I want to give them a platform, even if they are just getting used to the idea of putting their work out into the world. The zine is handmade, simple, and full of tiny errors. It's exactly what I want it to be, and it will evolve as its contributors do.</p>
	<p>If you want to contribute to a future issue, here's what you need to know:
